# lora-garden-transmitter
Uses Jim Booth's LoRa transmitter hardware to send info about the Tower Garden to Jim's LoRa receiver hardware:
- Water level
- pH of the water
- Info about each auto-fill
- Battery voltage

It also operates the Tower Garden:
- Turns the circulation pump on/off (3 minutes on, 5 minutes off)
- Automatically refills the tub when the level gets too low
